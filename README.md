# Smartract-Prototype

### Intro
Smartract is a startup under NTUitive programme, founded by a group of passionate individuals dedicated to build a digital contracting platform which aims to elevate trust and convenience in transactions.

I joined this programme as a software engineer to create a prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Authorized Users
1) Contract Owner
2) Contract Partner
3) Smartract Administrator

### Ideal Process Flow
1) Agreement Owner (ABC) creates an agreement with details including agreement partner (XYZ), agreement start date, milestones, etc., using available templates. Agreement creation and modification date shall be per system date, and upon completion, ABC shall indicate the email address which the agreement is to be addressed to for acceptance.
2) XYZ receives an email from ABC and will need to create itself as an authorized user.
3) When system detects a match of the signed-in user with the email address which ABC has addressed the agreement to, XYZ will see the agreement in its inbox for acceptance. 
4) If there are changes needed to the proposed agreement, Agreement Partner can notate/remark on the agreement and send the accepted/revised agreement back to Agreement Owner.
5) The to-and-fro may occur several times before both parties reach a conclusion to the agreement and indicate their acceptance on the agreement.
6) The finalized agreement shall be converted to PDF format and emailed to both ABC and XYZ with the message "Congratulations on the conclusion of your agreeement and wish you every success!" and copy to Smartract Administrator.
